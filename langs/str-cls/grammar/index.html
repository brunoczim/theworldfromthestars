Besides some innovations and new phrases, the dialect&#39;s grammar was considerably stable.</p><div id=nouns class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#nouns">Nouns</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Nouns in Classical Star Language are similar to nouns in English. They usually are the direct representative of things in the language, rather than referring to them in an indirect way like pronouns do. Another difference between them is that nouns can take adjectives, while pronouns don&#39;t.</p><p class="paragraph">Nouns vary in case, gender and number. Some nouns won&#39;t have a form in all genders or in all numbers, but will always inflect for case. The cases are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Nominative</li><li>Accusative</li><li>Topical</li><li>Postpositional</li></ul><p class="paragraph">The nominative case is used when the noun is the subject (it agrees with the verb). The accusative is used when the noun is a (direct) object but without any preposition (it is an important argument to a verb, without agreement). Topical case is used when the noun is the topic of a clause, and not the &quot;comment&quot;. Postpositional is used when a postposition follows the noun.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
