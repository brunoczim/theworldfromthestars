Besides some innovations and new phrases, the dialect&#39;s grammar was considerably stable.</p><div id=nouns class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#nouns">Nouns</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Nouns in Classical Star Language are similar to nouns in English. They usually are the direct representative of things in the language, rather than referring to them in an indirect way like pronouns do. Another difference between them is that nouns can take adjectives, while pronouns don&#39;t. Nouns vary in case, gender and number.</p><p class="paragraph">The cases are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Nominative</li><li>Accusative</li><li>Topical</li><li>Postpositional</li></ul><p class="paragraph">The nominative case is used when the noun is the subject (it agrees with the verb). The accusative is used when the noun is a (direct) object but without any preposition (it is an important argument to a verb, without agreement). Topical case is used when the noun is the topic of a clause, and not the &quot;comment&quot;. Postpositional is used when a postposition follows the noun.</p><p class="paragraph">The genders are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Divine</li><li>Animate</li><li>Inanimate</li></ul><p class="paragraph">The divine gender usually refers to the gods or a manifestation of gods, such as elements from the nature. The animate gender is used normally referring to things having a non-divine spirit; something that is alive and mortal. Inanimate gender refers to things that are lifeless. It is worth noting the words don&#39;t always match their gender&#39;s description.</p><p class="paragraph">The numbers are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Singular</li><li>Plural</li><li>Nullar</li><li>Collective</li></ul><p class="paragraph">The singular number is used when the noun refers to exactly one single thing. The plural number is used when the noun refers to an indefinite amount, but bigger than one. Nullar is used to refer to an amount of zero. Collective is used to refer to every possible entity of the noun; it is used when it refers to all of them.</p><p class="paragraph">Nouns are divided in inflection classes. Some inflection classes vary in all case, gender and number. Some varies only in case and gender, having a fixed number. Other varies only in case and number, having a fixed gender. There are also the ones that vary only in case, having fixed gender and number.</p></div></div><div id=adjectives class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#adjectives">Adjectives</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Adjectives in Classical Star Language are similar to adjectives in English. They modify nouns by giving more information about a noun&#39;s characteristics. They vary in case, gender and number, with the same types of case, gender and number as nouns. Adjectives must agree in case, gender and number with their nouns. Adjectives also have inflection classes, but they always vary in case, number and gender.</p></div></div><div id=pronouns class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#pronouns">Pronouns</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Pronouns refer to things indirectly. They usually carry a reference to something, but they might be expletive (carries no actual meaning). Pronouns vary in case, gender, number and person. Gender and number are the same as with nouns. Cases, besides the ones used with nouns, there is also the intransitive case. The intransitive case distinguishes itself from the nominative case such that:</p><ol class="ordered-list"><li>The verb takes no arguments except the subject;</li><li>The subject is the patient of the action, that is, it involuntarily suffers the action.</li></ol><p class="paragraph">There are three persons. Not only personal pronouns vary in person. They are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>First (1st)</li><li>Second (2nd)</li><li>Third (3rd)</li></ul><p class="paragraph">The first person refer to who is speaking. The second person refers to who is being spoken to. The third person refers to something that is neither of these.</p></div></div><div id=postpositions class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#postpositions">Postpositions</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Postpositions usually give information about a kind of motion, a manner of location or a manner of time. Postpositions are similar to English&#39;s prepositions, except they are words written after the noun phrases (hence post); the noun phrases are inflected in the postpositional cases then. Postpositions inflect for the case which the noun would take if it weren&#39;t followed by the postposition. Besides the same cases as nouns, postpositions also inflect for the intransitive case, like pronouns.</p></div></div><div id=conjunctions class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#conjunctions">Conjunctions</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Conjunctions are used to connect phrases or even whole clauses, like in English. In Star Language, however, they may also be used to nominalize verbs. The requirement for conjunctions is also more extreme in Star Language: they are required in order to create a noun compound. In the case of connecting noun phrases, the noun phrases are inflected with the noun phrase&#39;s case normally. Conjunctions are inflected for case. Besides the same cases as nouns, and also the intransitive case, they have a default case called coordenative, used when connecting two clauses.</p></div></div><div id=verbs class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#verbs">Verbs</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Verbs in Star Language are similar to verbs in English. They play a central role in a clause, and usually specifies the main action of the clause, but not necessarily. Verbs inflect for person, mood and tense. The persons are the same as with the pronouns.</p><p class="paragraph">Moods are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Indicative</li><li>Imperative</li></ul><p class="paragraph">Imperative mood gives orders. Indicative is used for anything else.</p><p class="paragraph">Indicative tenses are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Present</li><li>Past</li><li>Near-Future</li><li>Far-Future</li></ul><p class="paragraph">The name of the tenses pretty much explain themselves. Past is something that has already occured. Present is occuring right now. Near-Future will occur soon. Far-Future will occur in a long time. Difference betweeen the two futures are relative.</p><p class="paragraph">Imperative tenses are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Present</li><li>Future</li></ul><p class="paragraph">Present means an order to be executed now. Future is an order meant to be executed in a somewhat far future.</p></div></div><div id=adverbs class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#adverbs">Adverb</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Adverbs are words that modify verbs. They work like adverbs in English. Adverbs inflect for mood.</p><p class="paragraph">Moods are:</p><ul class="ordered-list"><li>Indicative</li><li>Subjunctive</li><li>Interrogative</li><li>Optative</li><li>Imperative</li></ul><p class="paragraph">Every adverb mood relates to a verb mood, and they must agree. Indicative agrees to the verb&#39;s indicative and express certainty. Subjunctive agrees to the verb&#39;s indicative, and express doubt or hypothesis. Interrogative also agrees to the verb&#39;s indicativee, and is used to ask a question. Optative agrees to the verb&#39;s imperative, and is used to express a wish or a hope. Imperative agrees to the verb&#39;s imperative and express orders.</p></div></div><div id=roots class="section section-1"><h2 class="header"><a class="header-link" href="../../../langs/str-cls/grammar/index.html#roots">Roots</a></h2><div class="section-body"><p class="paragraph">Roots are templates used to create words. They might combine with another root or create words directly. Roots may yield words of any part of speech.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
